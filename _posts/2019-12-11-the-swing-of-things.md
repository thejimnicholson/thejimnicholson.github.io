It used to be mildly entertaining watching the country tear itself apart. Now it's just boring and tedious. For those of you caught up in the current impeachment nonsense (and it is all nonsense, on both sides) I'd like to remind you that what you're watching is two sides arguing about power neither of them deserves or has used for your benefit. We are less safe, less free, and more uncertain that we've been in the course of my lifetime. 

Meanwhile, forces opposed to normal human decency and liberty are conspiring to leverage technology to destroy our culture, society, and country. 

If you ask me what I think we need, we need to go on a diet. We need less government, and we need government to be less important. We need less of what passes for media these days. We need to get out with each other and talk more, and talk about things other than which of the two otherwise indistiguishably evil sides should run things.

Please don't talk to me about impeachment. I'm certain of two things:
+ If you hate Trump, you hate him for the wrong reasons, and 
+ if you like him, you like him primarily because it makes other people hate him. 

This is no way to survive as a country, and I won't play this stupid game.

I hope you have a good holiday. I hope your holiday is about the things that it's supposed to be about: joy, hope, redemption, family and friends. 

And I hope that if you bring up politics during this time, you get punched in the face and drop-kicked out into the snow.
