This year<br/>
we managed to get<br/>
about as far away<br/>
from Bethlehem as you<br/>
can get and still<br/>
not come up against<br/>
someone's silly border enforcement.

The air is<br/>
wet, and cold. Bitter cold<br/>
and the ground is soaked and wet<br/>
and we are all<br/>
huddling in our rooms<br/>
with the space heaters<br/>
that replace furnaces<br/>
in these California-style apartments<br/>
built too far north.

Everything about<br/>
Christmas is a miracle<br/>
from the way we broken few<br/>
come together as a family<br/>
to the call-outs to<br/>
some vaguely described events<br/>
in a hotel-cum-stable<br/>
two thousand years ago.

Even so, come, Lord Jesus.<br/>
We've got things ready.<br/>
We've taken out the kitchen trash and<br/>
all the recycling<br/>
and our bitter hearts<br/>
might just, perhaps<br/>
be ready for whatever miracle<br/>
you can perform.
