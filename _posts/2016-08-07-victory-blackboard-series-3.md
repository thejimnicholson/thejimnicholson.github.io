Note: A Berliner Weisse is not the beer to have after a bunch of IPAs. It's probably a very good representation of this type of beer, which is also why Germans drink Berliner Weisse beers "mit Schuss." Unlike other American Berliners, Victory has elected to give you the straight-on sour of an un-spiked Berliner Weisse, so expect sour.
