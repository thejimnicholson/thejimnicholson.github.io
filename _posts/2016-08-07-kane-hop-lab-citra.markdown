__Kane Hop Lab Citra__ <http://www.kanebrewing.com/> - another Pale ale . Powerful citrus, zings right out of the box with the first taste. Very smooth. None of the aftertaste of the Dark City. Went well up against pretzels and mustard. Good like the Conclave Hop Ritual, maybe even better balanced.
