<a href="/assets/posts/IMG_0170_edited.jpg" data-lightbox="IMG_0170_edited" data-title="American Bright Ale" class="thumbnail"><img src="/assets/posts/tn_IMG_0170_edited.jpg"></a> Crisp and clean, smooth. Had a vague, very mild chemical taste when I started, but that might have been my sore mouth; it went away fast. As the bottle wore on, I got a very distinct nutty finish that was quite surprising and very pleasant. This was a single bottle from a mixed six-pack we got in upstate NY, and it left me wishing I had picked up a few more. I'll be watching for this one; it makes my short list.
