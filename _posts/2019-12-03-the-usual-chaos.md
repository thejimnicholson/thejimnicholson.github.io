Here I am, up at 2:30am again. Lots of stuff going on this week, time for a brain dump.

Got a new Chromebook, as the old one had worn out a bit and finally suffered some fatal damage when the cats decided to knock it off the bed. That one was an 11" ASUS [C101](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3256030/asus-chromebook-flip-c101pa-review.html) or something, ARM-based, tiny, with the fold-over panel that put it into "tablet" mode. Never used that much, as ChromeOS really isn't a tablet OS, and it was easier to keep using the real hardware keyboard.

The new one is __much__ larger, the [C523N](https://www.pcmag.com/review/366315/asus-chromebook-c523). I got it as a compromise, figuring it would keep me from buying another full laptop for a while. It supports Crostini, which is Google's official way to run Linux apps on ChomeOS (via an lxc container, interesting stuff.) So far, I've managed to get it to run Ubuntu rather than the Debian default container, and got a bunch of stuff installed on it (including VS Code, which I'm using to write this now.) The battery life isn't what the smaller one was, but it seems to work well enough for what I'm doing with it.  It's much more portable than my cumbersome 17" gaming laptop (which is showing its age, but has a little more life in it thanks to an SSD upgrade.)

One of my recent projects has been to put together an ansible playbook that configured my "development environment," since I have so many of them now. That's been going about as one might expect; the differences between Windows Subsystem for Linux, Crostini-hosted Ubuntu, and native Ubuntu are small, but can be a pain. Nothing like trying to get things to mesh with the RedHat systems at work, though. 

Made some bread and some music.  Need to get better organized about the podcast stuff, and had some ideas for doing an episode on twitch streaming. Stay tuned.
