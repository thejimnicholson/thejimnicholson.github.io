__Carton Monkey Chased the Weasel__ <http://cartonbrewing.com/> - Like a lot of American breweries, Carton is trying here to capture the experience of a Berliner Weisse without actually dropping the Schuss. Whether it works or not is for a more sober reviewer than I to say. I liked it, but I'm switching to whiskey from here on out.
