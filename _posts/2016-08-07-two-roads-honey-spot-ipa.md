__Two Roads Honey Spot IPA__ <http://tworoadsbrewing.com/> - It's not fair to drink this after the Sleeper Cell. This is a decent beer, and it's an interesting twist on the IPA model. It uses ale yeasts, and the result is a softer, wheatier taste than other IPAs. At 6.0% ABV, it's on the high end of sessionable beers, but it would go great with spicier summer dishes.
