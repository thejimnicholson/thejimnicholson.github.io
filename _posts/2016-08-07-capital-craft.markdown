I went to [Capital Craft](http://capitalcraftnj.com/) and had a couple of flights. Besides excellent food, Capital Craft is a great place to go if you want to try _many_ excellent craft beers. They have a great menu (always changing,) and they have reasonably priced flights that let you sample them all without turning your liver into a puddle and your wallet into pocket lint. Even so, I took a designated driver.
