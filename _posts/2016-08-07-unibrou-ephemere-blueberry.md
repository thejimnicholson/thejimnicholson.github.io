This is a fruit beer. You get fruit on the nose. You get fruit up front. You get a fruit finish. It's not overly sweet. It's very well done. It's even carbonated just right. You can say one thing about the Québécois: they can make a very drinkable beverage. Is it a beer? Well, it's 5.5% ABV. (I missed most of the spicy finish everyone talks about with this beer.)
