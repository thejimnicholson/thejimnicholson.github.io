We are all finding new ways to cope with the current crisis. I've started a few projects this year to keep my mind off viruses. 

+ [Mountain iDentifier](https://thejimnicholson.com) is an original music and prose podcast that I've started a while ago. I suspect that, in the comming month, I'll have plenty of time to work on it. 
+ [Kuberetes on Pi](https://project.kube.thejimnicholson.com) is a blog specifically for my Raspberry Pi Kubernetes cluster, which is nerd-speak for "I'm building my own cloud at home."
