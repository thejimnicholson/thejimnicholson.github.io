title: Better Onion-baked Chicken
---

**Ingredients:**

* 1/4 cup margarine/vegetable spread
* 1/2 package Lipton onion soup mix.
* 3 tablespoons garlic powder
* 1/4 cup bread crumbs
* 2 lbs. boneless chicken thighs (or breasts, or tenders, as you prefer.)

**Directions:**

Preheat oven to 350F.

Melt margarine in microwave (20-30 secs, varies based on your microwave.)

In a 1 gallon zip-lock bag, combine onion soup mix, garlic powder, and bread crumbs. Seal bag and mix thoroughly.

Add margarine and chicken to the bag. Seal and mix until no "loose" mixture remains.

Place on a foil-lined sheet and bake in the oven for 40 minutes. After 20 minutes, turn each piece over if uniform crust is desired.
