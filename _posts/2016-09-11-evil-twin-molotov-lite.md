"Throw some more hops in," I imagine someone said. "It will taste delicious," they said. "What could possibly go wrong?"  Well, not much, for hop lovers. This is a very simple beer with a deceptively complex finish. I simply couldn't pick any particular hop out, but there were plenty.  The hops mask the alcohol, so be careful.
