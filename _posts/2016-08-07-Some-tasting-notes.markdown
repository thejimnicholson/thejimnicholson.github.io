I went to [Capital Craft](http://capitalcraftnj.com/) and had a couple of flights. Besides excellent food, Capital Craft is a great place to go if you want to try _many_ excellent craft beers. They have a great menu (always changing,) and they have reasonably priced flights that let you sample them all without turning your liver into a puddle and your wallet into pocket lint. Even so, I took a designated driver. Here are some impressions. 








__Weyerbacher Merry Monks__ <http://www.weyerbacher.com/> - Cheating again. I've had this. Belgian Trippel. It's good. Have some.

Next, we try a few more IPAs and some Berliner Weisse

__Founders Sleeper Cell__ <https://foundersbrewing.com/> - Oh. My. God. Many years ago, I had a double Imperial pilsner from a now-defunct Oregon brewery called "Sneaker Wave." It was nothing at all like this beer, except for one  thing: in both beers, you can't taste the alcohol. At all. This would be an amazing IPA like the All Day except that for one thing: it's 10.8% ABV. And you'll never know, except that I just told you. Damn, I ruined it. On the other hand, I just saved you a possible DWI. You're welcome.

__Two Roads Honey Spot IPA__ <http://tworoadsbrewing.com/> - It's not fair to drink this after the Sleeper Cell. This is a decent beer, and it's an interesting twist on the IPA model. It uses ale yeasts, and the result is a softer, wheatier taste than other IPAs. At 6.0% ABV, it's on the high end of sessionable beers, but it would go great with spicier summer dishes.

__Victory Blackboard Series #3__ <http://www.victorybeer.com/> - A Berliner Weisse is not the beer to have after a bunch of IPAs. I'm just saying. It's probably a very good representation of this type of beer, which is also why Germans drink Berliner Weisse beers "mit Schuss."

__Carton Monkey Chased the Weasel__ <http://cartonbrewing.com/> - Like a lot of American breweries, Carton is trying here to capture the experience of a Berliner Weisse without actually dropping the Schuss. Whether it works or not is for a more sober reviewer than I to say. I liked it, but I'm switching to whiskey from here on out.
