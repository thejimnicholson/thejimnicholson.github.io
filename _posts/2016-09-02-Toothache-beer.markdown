 Crisp and clean, smooth. Had a vague, very mild chemical taste when I started, but that might have been my sore mouth; it went away fast. As the bottle wore on, I got a very distinct nutty finish that was quite surprising and very pleasant. This was a single bottle from a mixed six-pack we got in upstate NY, and it left me wishing I had picked up a few more. I'll be watching for this one; it makes my short list.
