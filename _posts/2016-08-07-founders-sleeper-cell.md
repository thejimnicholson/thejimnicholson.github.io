Many years ago, I had a double Imperial pilsner from a now-defunct Oregon brewery called "Sneaker Wave." It was nothing at all like this beer, except for one  thing: in both beers, you can't taste the alcohol. At all. This would be an amazing IPA like the All Day except that for one thing: it's 10.8% ABV. And you'll never know, except that I just told you. Damn, I ruined it. On the other hand, I just saved you a possible DWI. You're welcome.
