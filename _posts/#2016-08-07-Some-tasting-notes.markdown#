I went to [Capital Craft](http://capitalcraftnj.com/) and had a couple of flights. Besides excellent food, Capital Craft is a great place to go if you want to try _many_ excellent craft beers. They have a great menu (always changing,) and they have reasonably priced flights that let you sample them all without turning your liver into a puddle and your wallet into pocket lint. Even so, I took a designated driver. Here are some impressions. 

__Kane Hop Lab Citra__ <http://www.kanebrewing.com/> - another Pale ale . Powerful citrus, zings right out of the box with the first taste. Very smooth. None of the aftertaste of the Dark City. Went well up against pretzels and mustard. Good like the Conclave Hop Ritual, maybe even better balanced.

__Brix City Belgian Dubbel__ <http://www.brixcitybrewing.com/> - Rich. Malty. Sweetness. What you'd expect in a dubbel, but it avoids being cloy about it. Probably my favorite of the four. The high ABV (8.0) is well disguised in this beer. Could easily get you into trouble. Possibly even a paternity suit, if you aren't careful.

__Demented Dementia__ <https://www.dementedbrewing.com/> - IPA. What an IPA is support to be, but I'm getting a little of that chemical aftertaste like the Dark City has.

__Southern Tier 2X IPA__ <http://www.stbcbeer.com/> - Smooth, bitter, and jumps around on the tough. Nice though. I'd probably drink a pint.

__River Horse Hippotizing IPA__ <http://www.riverhorse.com/agegate.php> - Another good IPA from a consistently good brewery. Everything River Horse makes is drinkable. Watch this one, at 7.5% ABV, it might sneak up on you. Interesting concept too, mixing American and European hops for a nice complex flavor. And manages to avoid the IPA aftertaste.

__Unibrou Ephemere Blueberry__ <http://www.unibroue.com/en/home> - This is a fruit beer. You get fruit on the nose. You get fruit up front. You get a fruit finish. It's not overly sweet. It's very well done. It's even carbonated just right. Whatever else you thing about the Quebecois, they can make a very drinkable beverage. Is it a beer? Well, it's 5.5% ABV. (I missed most of the spicy finish everyone talks about with this beer.)

__Founder's All Day IPA__ <https://foundersbrewing.com/> - Cheating, because I've had this one before, and at this point, my palette is pretty much all over the place after all these beers. I'm sure it will be good (haven't actually tried it yet.) (OK, now I have.) And it delivers. What to order if you want an IPA.

__Weyerbacher Merry Monks__ <http://www.weyerbacher.com/> - Cheating again. I've had this. Belgian Trippel. It's good. Have some.

Next, we try a few more IPAs and some Berliner Weisse

__Founders Sleeper Cell__ <https://foundersbrewing.com/> - Oh. My. God. Many years ago, I had a double Imperial pilsner from a now-defunct Oregon brewery called "Sneaker Wave." It was nothing at all like this beer, except for one  thing: in both beers, you can't taste the alcohol. At all. This would be an amazing IPA like the All Day except that for one thing: it's 10.8% ABV. And you'll never know, except that I just told you. Damn, I ruined it. On the other hand, I just saved you a possible DWI. You're welcome.

__Two Roads Honey Spot IPA__ <http://tworoadsbrewing.com/> - It's not fair to drink this after the Sleeper Cell. This is a decent beer, and it's an interesting twist on the IPA model. It uses ale yeasts, and the result is a softer, wheatier taste than other IPAs. At 6.0% ABV, it's on the high end of sessionable beers, but it would go great with spicier summer dishes.

__Victory Blackboard Series #3__ <http://www.victorybeer.com/> - A Berliner Weisse is not the beer to have after a bunch of IPAs. I'm just saying. It's probably a very good representation of this type of beer, which is also why Germans drink Berliner Weisse beers "mit Schuss."

__Carton Monkey Chased the Weasel__ <http://cartonbrewing.com/> - Like a lot of American breweries, Carton is trying here to capture the experience of a Berliner Weisse without actually dropping the Schuss. Whether it works or not is for a more sober reviewer than I to say. I liked it, but I'm switching to whiskey from here on out.
