I went to [Capital Craft](http://capitalcraftnj.com/) and had a couple of flights. Besides excellent food, Capital Craft is a great place to go if you want to try _many_ excellent craft beers. They have a great menu (always changing,) and they have reasonably priced flights that let you sample them all without turning your liver into a puddle and your wallet into pocket lint. Even so, I took a designated driver. Here are some impressions. 










Next, we try a few more IPAs and some Berliner Weisse



__Two Roads Honey Spot IPA__ <http://tworoadsbrewing.com/> - It's not fair to drink this after the Sleeper Cell. This is a decent beer, and it's an interesting twist on the IPA model. It uses ale yeasts, and the result is a softer, wheatier taste than other IPAs. At 6.0% ABV, it's on the high end of sessionable beers, but it would go great with spicier summer dishes.

__Victory Blackboard Series #3__ <http://www.victorybeer.com/> - A Berliner Weisse is not the beer to have after a bunch of IPAs. I'm just saying. It's probably a very good representation of this type of beer, which is also why Germans drink Berliner Weisse beers "mit Schuss."
