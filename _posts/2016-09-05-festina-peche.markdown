A mild Berliner Weisse, not cloyingly tart. I have no idea whether this is representative of the style, but it's a nice first sour beer, if you're not sure you'll like sours. Unlike some other American breweries, Dogfish Head hasn't tried to reproduce the classic "mit schuss" taste of the Berliner Weisse; those other efforts often end up tasting ridiculously like a sour shandy.  On the other hand, this one is a one and done for me; I'm not a huge sour fan.
