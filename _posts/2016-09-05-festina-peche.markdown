A mild Berlinerweise, not cloyingly tart. I have no idea whether this is representative of the style, but it's a nice first sour beer, if you're not sure you'll like sours. Unlike other American Breweries, Dogfish Head hasn't tried to reproduce the classic "mit schuss" taste of the Berlinerweise; those other efforts often end up tasting ridiculously like a sour shandy.  On the other hand, this one is a one and done for me; I'm not a huge sour fan.
