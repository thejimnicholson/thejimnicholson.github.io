__Brix City Belgian Dubbel__ <http://www.brixcitybrewing.com/> - Rich. Malty. Sweetness. What you'd expect in a dubbel, but it avoids being cloy about it. Probably my favorite of the four. The high ABV (8.0) is well disguised in this beer. Could easily get you into trouble. Possibly even a paternity suit, if you aren't careful.
