  title: blog reboot
  ---
  
  It's been a while. 
  
  I know this about myself: I'm easily distracted. I also know that my drive to journal and blog has diminished quite a bit in the
  past 15 years. There was a time when, between my public blog, posts on other Internet forums, and my personal (handwritten) journal, 
  virtually every aspect of my life was in some way being recorded.
  
  I could talk about the circumstances that caused me to change there, but it would take a whole book to explain everything, and frankly, 
  the details are both painful and boring to me at this point.
  
  I've continued to bake, and there should be some new posts about that soon. 
  
  I've taken a full-time position, so my life has settled down from the constant hustle of consulting/contracting. 
  
  I've settled into my new home, 2500 miles from where I've spent most of my life. 
  
  My children are grown. We've burried a dog, and adopted a kitten.
  
  We've been busy, but (apart from "social media", which seems both pervasive and impenitrable these days,) much of that will go 
  undocumented. 
  
  I've been dabbling in golang. I've written a bit of python code. I've learned ansible. 
  
  I'm going to try and keep this updated more frequently. That's a promise I'm making to myself.
