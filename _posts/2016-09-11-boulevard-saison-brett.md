I will confess that I generally dislike [brettanomyces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brettanomyces) in my beer; the funky "earthy" taste just puts me off. But if you're like me, and you want a good intro to the style that doesn't overpower you, this is a fine place to start. Gets more interesting as you get into it.
