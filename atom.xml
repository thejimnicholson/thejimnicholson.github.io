<p>I recently started a new job. After years of working inside a &ldquo;walled garden,&rdquo; where I had limited access to clients and limited ability to work remotely, I&rsquo;m now a consultant working mostly on short-term projects.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another new blog? Yep, despite my reservations, I&rsquo;m determined to try this out. Actually, static site generation makes a great deal of sense considering the way blogs get hijacked these days.</p>

<p>Anyway, the first topic I&rsquo;m going to address (in my typical ADHD fashion) is VPN access. Stay tuned.</p>
