Jim Nicholson has been working on and writing things about the Internet and his other interests for years. Sometimes, he is entertaining. Sometimes, he is infuriating. Sometimes, he is wrong. Often, he turns out to be right.

Among other things, Jim is produces the [Mountain iDentifer](https://anchor.fm/jim-nicholson4) podcast, which can be all of the things Jim's blog can be.
