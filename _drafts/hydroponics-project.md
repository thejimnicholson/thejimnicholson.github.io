title: Hydroponics project
---

I'm going to take a break from my posts about breadmaking for a bit and talk about another project I've been working on: growing lettuce and peppers via a homemade hydroponics system. Don't worry, I'm still making bread, and I will have some new recipes to talk about soon.

I found out about Kratky hydroponics while browsing YouTube for baking videos. There are several introductory videos to be found, and some cover the on-the-cheap approach that uses primarily recycled materials. I built my system using Ball mason jars; the items I ended up purchasing were

+ 3" net cups
+ Rockwool cubes (growing medium)

If you're creative, you can avoid buying net cups by recycling yogurt containers and cutting slits into them. I did this with several different brands of yogurt; if you're using mason jars, take a ring with you when you go shopping and try different containers out for size. I found a local brand, Tillamook, that works great with wide-mouth quart-sized jars. Some other brands were a bit wider; I created containers for them using cheap plastic canisters I found at a dollar store near my house.

I started my first seedlings in peat pots from a nursery. I don't recommend this, as the peat pots are hard to re-use and they will leach into the water when you are starting plants. It's a lot easier to start in Rockwool cubes, and you won't have to transplant them if you do; you can just push the rockwool into your net cups when the plants are big enough to take out of the starter container.
